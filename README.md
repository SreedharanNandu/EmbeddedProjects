** MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE ELECTRONCS WORLD **


My little Intro :- My passion for electronics started in teens building superhet/crystal radio's and things changed when i came across the golden device "WALKMAN" back in 90s & 2000s with unique feature that no other audio device even today can reproduce the vibration,the "MEGA BASS"....wow.
           Deep dive "MEGA BASS" , found the chip that changed my audio perception ,the infamous LA4582 (SANYO) that i could not experience in any other chips even with 24 bit DSPs today...its that unique LPF design effect thats impossible to set using traditional GEQ or PEQs.
           The passion for digitals started when first CD "DTS' intro hit my ears at a local movie theatre...wanting to understand what is digital electronics and how it controls mixed signal circuits.

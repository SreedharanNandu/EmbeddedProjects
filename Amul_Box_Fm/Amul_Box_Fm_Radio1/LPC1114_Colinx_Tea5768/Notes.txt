This project was rebuilt on 30/12/24 due to bad 3.3v regulator and AMP replace.
This project uses TEA5768 and LPC1114 micro, uses LM75 for Temp sensing and AT24 EE for NVM. The coocox link and related files doesn't work in Win11 
so use Keil with legacy pack which supports this micro.

The radio works on power up with channel 0 frequency preloaded in manual mode,then use rotarty +/- to tune manually
By pressing rotary button, preset mode is entered with 10 preloaded frequency.
Then again pressing the rotary button moves to manual mode, then use long press to store that frequency to preset
The disp info is sent over UART 9600bps optionally on BT SPP board like HC06 which prints frequency /Temperature etc

The BT HC-0x introduces 2.4gnz ping noise over UART lines and Power lines esp can be heard on certain freq bands
--used DC DC converted but noise was not eliminated.

Futurue work :-
 Porting if micro gone bad
 Move chassis if broken
 Add disp or serial BT with low noise floor after extreme testing
